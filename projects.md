# Selected Research Projects

## MediGlot 2.0: Biomedical RAG & Embedding Platform
Built a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with BioBERT/SciBERT + FAISS to explore biomedical language embeddings.  
Developed embedding audits using UMAP and HDBSCAN, uncovering semantic shifts across language communities.

## UniCrisiNet: Multimodal Disaster Reasoning Network
Designed ViT-based fusion architecture combining aerial and ground imagery for hazard segmentation and severity prediction.  
Introduced hazard-interaction modules and cross-view consistency losses for explainable crisis AI.

## AutoMorph + RETFound
Implemented retinal segmentation and vessel morphology analysis using foundation models for interpretability and domain generalization.

## FedDAF: Federated Driver Attention Framework
Developed a personalized federated model for behavioral sequence prediction, improving minority-class F1 by 18% via cost-sensitive loss and selective aggregation.
